CWRU Boot Camp Homework Week 9

This project entailed creating a database from provided CSV files. The files describe the employment information for a fictional company, Pewlett Hackard. The below is the ERD created from these files:

In terms of data analysis, eight queries were written to demonstrate the ability to pull data from the database based on certain requirements, including narrowing the search based on the year an employee was hired, joining department names on employee number, and filtering based on a keyword and a wildcard search.

The schema that was created to map the CSVs to the database is contained in schema.sql.

The queries for data analysis are contained in query.sql.

The CSVs used for the base data are in the 'data' folder.
